# suidsgui
This package contains files for suidsgui
I ran out of Ideas so I abandoned this project and uploaded it to github so that sone who needs it can use this.
The main class is logingui.java.
The help.java does work but does not have any content in it to show.
To run the program simply run the logingui.java class and it will ask you for a Username and a Password.
The username is "Shubham" which Ignore case and the password is "shubham" which is case sensitive.
